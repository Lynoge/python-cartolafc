Python Cartola FC API
=====================

.. include:: badges.rst

Welcome to Python CartolaFC's documentation. This project is a python interface into the Cartola FC API. `Cartola FC <https://cartolafc.globo.com/>`__
is a fantasy sport about football, meaning it is a fictional game in which people create their teams with real life
football players. It was released in the year 2005.

Created and maintained by `Globo.com <http://www.globo.com/>`__ and promoted by the cable TV channel
`Sportv <http://sportv.globo.com/>`__, this virtual soccer game already has more than 3 million registered users. At the
start of the 2016 season, the game recorded its best-ever scoring team in a single round in 12 years of fantasy history,
an incredible 2,723,915 users set up their teams for the first round of the 2016 Brazilian Championship.

Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as
more conventional python objects.
